# Per-File Concurrency Control

## Design Choice: Per-File Mutex Locks

### Why Per-File?
- Allows concurrent operations on different files
- Serializes conflicting operations on same file
- Prevents race conditions like simultaneous DELETE + UPLOAD

### Implementation:
1. Each `file_t` struct has `pthread_mutex_t file_lock`
2. Workers acquire file lock before any operation
3. Lock released after disk I/O + metadata update complete

### Trade-offs:
**Pros:**
- Fine-grained locking (better concurrency)
- Simple to reason about
- No deadlocks (single lock acquisition)

**Cons:**
- More memory (one mutex per file)
- Need to handle lock cleanup on file deletion
```
